                                        players, coaches, families and fans the opportunity to travel and compete
                                        internationally with people of differing cultures, producing games and tours in

                                <p>The American Professional Football Association was formed, a little bit later
                                    National Football League was established. The two organizations were competing for
                                    players which drove up salaries.</p>
                                <p>In 1966 they merged and agreed that each league champion would meet in a game called
                                    the Super Bowl. In the ensuing years, football has become the most popular sport in
                                    America - a billion-dollar business and a vital part of American Thanksgiving and
                                    New Year celebrations. The Super Bowl is now unofficial holiday and a worldwide
                                    phenomenon. Last week, the Denver Broncos sacked head coach, Mike Shanahan, after
                                    the club failed to reach the play-offs following a poor run of form. Shanahan joined
                                    the club as head coach in 1995 after being associated with them in one way or
                                    another for many years and he experienced some success during his reign.</p>
                                <p>The Broncos won the Super Bowl in 1998 and managed to defend their title the
                                    following year. Although the club won half of their matches this season, several bad
                                    results towards the latter stages left them unable to be a part of the play-offs.
                                    During his time at the club, Shanahan won 146 matches and lost a total of 89.</p>
                                <p>Shanahanâ€™s sacking has come as a shock to many, especially since he was such an
                                    experienced coach. Only Jeff Fisher, who became head coach of Tennessee in the early
                                    1990s, had been serving as a coach for longer than Shanahan.</p>
